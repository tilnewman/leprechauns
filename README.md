# leprechauns
 A simple simulation to help me teach C++.
 
 Consider a 2D game board with randomly placed pots of gold of value 1-99 and two actor pieces, or leprechauns.  Both move one square at a time toward pots of gold trying to collect the most gold.  One always targets pots with the most gold, called Greedy.  The other always targets pots that are closest to him, regardless of how much, called Lazy.  After a million turns, which leprechaun will repeatedly end up with the most gold?  How much of an impact is made by the size of the board and the amount of gold in each pot?  Start simulationâ€¦
